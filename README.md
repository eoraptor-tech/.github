Rust-Eoraptor is a platform dedicated to projects developed using the Rust programming language. The name is inspired by one of the oldest and most agile dinosaurs, reflecting our focus on creating robust, fast, and efficient software.

Many of the projects featured here were developed using AI-assisted coding (`Vaicoding`), a software development approach that leverages artificial intelligence to accelerate creation and experimentation.

We believe that AI-assisted coding can significantly enhance productivity and innovation in software development, allowing developers to focus on higher-level design and problem-solving while automating routine coding tasks.
